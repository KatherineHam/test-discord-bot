testing a text search discord bot 

    Bot Setup:
        intents.message_content = True is necessary to allow the bot to read message content in order to react to user input (as of 2022, Discord requires intents for reading message content).
        The commands.Bot() class creates a bot instance, and the command prefix ! means users will trigger bot commands with !search.

    Text File Search Function:
        search_files(keyword) takes a keyword and searches through all .txt files in a specific directory (TEXT_FILES_DIR). It reads each file line by line and checks if the keyword appears in that line (case-insensitive search).

    Command Handling:
        The search command listens for the keyword passed by the user and uses the search_files() function to find results. It then sends the results back to the Discord channel.
        If no results are found, it informs the user.

    Bot Token:
        Replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' with your bot’s token obtained from the Discord Developer Portal.

Step 4: Set Up Your Text Files

    Create a directory called text_files (or any other name you choose) in the same directory as your bot script. Place any .txt files you want to search through in this folder.

Step 5: Run the Bot

    Save your script as bot.py (or any other name you like).
    Run the bot:

    python bot.py

Step 6: Test Your Bot

    In Discord, type the following command:

    !search your_keyword

        The bot will search for the keyword in the text files in the text_files directory and send the results to the channel where the command was issued.

Optional Improvements:

    Add More Advanced Search Features:
        Use regular expressions to make searches more flexible.
        Add filters, such as searching for whole words only or ignoring certain types of lines.

    Make the Directory Dynamic:
        Allow the bot to search specific directories or folders by passing a path argument with the command.

    Limit Results:
        If the results are too large, you might want to paginate the results or send them in multiple messages to avoid hitting Discord’s message length limits.

You should place your text files in a specific folder that your bot will be able to access when searching. In the example provided, the bot is set to look for text files in a folder called text_files that is located in the same directory as your Python script.

Here’s how to set it up:
1. Create a Directory for Your Text Files

    In the folder where your Python bot script is located, create a new directory named text_files (or you can use any other name, but make sure to update the bot script to reflect that).

    For example, the folder structure would look like this:

    your-bot-directory/
      ├── bot.py  (your Python bot script)
      └── text_files/
            ├── file1.txt
            ├── file2.txt
            └── file3.txt

2. Modify the Script to Match the Folder Name

If you decide to name the folder something else, make sure you update the TEXT_FILES_DIR variable in your bot script to match the correct folder name. For example:

TEXT_FILES_DIR = './my_custom_folder'

3. Place Your .txt Files in This Folder

Put all the text files you want to search through inside the text_files directory (or whatever name you choose).

For example, you can have text files like:

    file1.txt
    file2.txt
    file3.txt

4. Running the Bot

Once your text files are in the text_files folder, you can run your bot as described earlier. When you send a search command like !search keyword, the bot will search through all the .txt files in that folder and return results to Discord.
Example Command in Discord:

!search your_keyword

The bot will search for your_keyword in all the .txt files in the text_files folder and return the lines that contain that keyword.
Important Notes:

    Permissions: Ensure that your bot has permission to read from the directory where your text files are stored. If you are running it on a remote server or different environment, make sure the file paths are correctly set up.
    File Format: Only .txt files will be searched based on the current bot configuration. If you want to search other file types (like .md or .log), you can modify the search_files function to include those as well.
